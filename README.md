brew install stikypiston/formulae/hocusfocus
```

## Usage

Run the `hocusfocus` command to enter the main interface

There are **three** session types to choose from: `Work`, `Study`, and `Waste`.

Use the `arrow keys` to navigate up and down, and use the `enter` key to select an option.

Press `enter` on one of the session types to start tracking it. When you are done, press `stop` to stop, or press another session's name to switch to that session.

Press `stats` to go to a stats page, which will show how long you have spent in each session overall.

Running `hocusfocus` with the `currentsession` argument will print the current session to the terminal.
