There are **three** session types to choose from: `Work`, `Study`, and `Waste`.

Use the `arrow keys` to navigate up and down, and use the `enter` key to select an option.

Press `enter` on one of the session types to start tracking it. When you are done, press `stop` to stop, or press another session's name to switch to that session.
